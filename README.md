# Bouncing Ball vs. Evil Circle

**Bouncing Ball vs. Evil Circle** is a fun and engaging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript game where a ball bounces around the screen, trying to avoid being swallowed by an evil circle. The goal is to survive as long as possible while controlling the ball to evade the evil circle.

## üéÆ Gameplay

- The player controls a **bouncing ball** that moves across the screen.
- The objective is to **avoid being swallowed** by the evil circle that roams around the screen.
- The game ends when the ball collides with the evil circle.
- The game speed increases gradually, making it more challenging.

## üñ•Ô∏è Features

- **Ball Movement**: The ball bounces off the edges of the screen.
- **Evil Circle AI**: The evil circle moves around the screen trying to catch the ball.
- **Mouse/Keyboard Controls**: The player can control the ball using the arrow keys or mouse.
- **Game Over Screen**: When the ball touches the evil circle, the game ends with a "Game Over" message.

## üí° How It Works

The game uses **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for interactivity. The ball and evil circle are rendered using simple DOM elements and styled using CSS. The movement logic is handled by JavaScript, and collision detection ensures the game ends when the ball is swallowed by the evil circle.
